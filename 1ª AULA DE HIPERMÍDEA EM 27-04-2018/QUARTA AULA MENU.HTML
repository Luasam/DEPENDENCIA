					There were always issues with the use of this attribute. Firstly, it is not well supported by major browsers. One reason not to support this attribute is that if browsers do so without special additional rules it would be an XSS attack vector. Secondly, it is hard to ensure that the information is correct at any given time. The author of the document pointed to may well change the encoding of the document without you knowing. If the author still hasn't specified the encoding of their document, you will now be asking the browser to apply an incorrect encoding. And thirdly, it shouldn't be necessary anyway if people follow the guidelines in this article and mark up their documents properly. That is a much better approach.
